# Distributed Chess Engine

## Engine Client

Each engine client will run its own copy of the chess game engine. 

### Master-Worker Model

Master and worker clients are functionally identical and differ only in their assigned tasks.

#### Master Client

This client generates a "top-cut" of the K most favorable moves given the current board state. It then sends out each of these moves to individual workers to perform further analysis on the subsequent board state generated by each move. 

In the event that the "master" client crashes, the workers will hold an election following a simple bully algorithm to determine which of them will be the next "master".

#### Worker Client

Performs deep analysis on the board state provided to it.
